OpenManus-RL is a memory planning agent designed for general environments, leveraging reinforcement learning. The project implements the REACT reasoning architecture (think→act→tool-use) and a multi-agent flow for action optimization. It features an MCP-compatible tool framework for automated tool invocation and output processing, and includes SFT datasets compatible with AgentBench environments such as Gaia, WebArena, WebShop, and AlfWorld.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. For example, OpenManus-RL supports:
- Automated tool invocation and output processing
- SFT datasets for AgentBench environments (Gaia, WebArena, WebShop, AlfWorld)
- Persona-encoding and multi-agent simulation
