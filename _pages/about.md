My research interests are in the field of LLM Agents, especially in next-generation AI agents that seamlessly bridge virtual and physical worlds through socially intelligent, tool-agnostic, and ethically grounded architectures, including:

- LLM Agents
- Multi-Agent Systems
- Persona Agent
- Multi-Modal Agents
  

Also some random [research ideas](https://lead-cardamom-96f.notion.site/Dreeumr-s-Idea-Planet-21752d1a5d76802da492e3d5d6a6be53?source=copy_link):
