  title={Understanding and Mitigating Bias Inheritance in LLM-based Data Augmentation},
  author={Zhang, Weijia},
  year={2025},
  abstract={Executed 30+ fine-tuning experiments using Llama-3.1 and ChatGPT-o1-mini with controlled bias blend ratios. Developed automated pipeline for synthetic data generation, bias injection, LoRA fine-tuning, and evaluation. Implemented and compared three bias mitigation strategies: token-based, mask-based, and loss-based approaches.}
